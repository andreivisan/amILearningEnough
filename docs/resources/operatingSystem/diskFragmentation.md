## Standards
- **POSIX.1-2017 (IEEE Std 1003.1-2017)**
  - While not directly addressing defragmentation, this standard defines file system operations that impact fragmentation.
  - Not freely available, but it's an authoritative source on standardized file system interfaces.

- **ISO/IEC 9945:2009 - Information technology -- Portable Operating System Interface (POSIXÂ®)**
  - This international standard is based on POSIX and includes specifications for file system operations.
  - Not freely available, but useful for understanding standardized file system interfaces that may impact fragmentation.
